JavaScript has a few uses in this web app:

1. Last Updated/Modified (top right corner of all pages)﻿﻿

2. In the Event Registration form (https://edoras.sdsu.edu/~cssc0220/events_registration.php), the total number of attendees is updated every time any category is changed


Additional JavaScript 

1. The index page has a color-changing background (colors in the shade of blue, white & purple are included, which change every 5 seconds, with a smooth transition between colors)

2. Extra functionality to the Last Updated / Modified feature is the two_digits method which converts single-digit "seconds", "minutes" & "hours" into two-digit numbers to reduce text flickering due to different time sizes

3. Disable Right-click (throughout the web app, the right-click functionality is added to prevent users from copying literary content or other functionalities that the right-click may hold

4. Display browser version (every page has a corner where the browser version is displayed; the placing of the version is a bit off in some pages, which will be worked on in future versions)
